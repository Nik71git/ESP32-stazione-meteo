# **ESP32 WEATHER STATION**

Welcome to my DIY weather station project based on ESP32, MISOL sensors for wind measurement and rain quantitative, Kemo M152K capacitive sensor for rain detection and DHT22 for temperature and humidity.

The goal is to have values in Home Assistant so Esphome is the choice due to API native integrations, for other hub solutions MQTT is needed, simple add it to the code.
